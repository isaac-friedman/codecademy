//Generating html in strings is generally a bad idea without a good rason
document.getElementById("body").innerHTML = "Check your console to understand this exercise."

let demoString = "This string is just long enough to be inconvenient to count by looking at it"

console.log(demoString + \n + "demoString is " + demoString.length + " characters long.")

console.log("The Nth character of demoString is located at demoString.N. For example if N = 17")
console.log(demostring.17)
